**☁️ Cloud Computing Journey**

Welcome to my Cloud Computing repository, where I document my learning, hands-on experiments, and projects. This repository covers cloud architecture, virtualization, storage, networking, and deployment using platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

**📌 About This Repository**

This repository serves as a structured guide to cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), serverless computing, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and cloud security. I’ll be working on real-world cloud deployments, scaling strategies, and best practices while sharing insights along the way.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud

Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

CI/CD Pipelines, Serverless Functions

Networking, Storage, Security
